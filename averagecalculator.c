/*
Write a C program that defines a function called calculateAverage that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters. The function should calculate the average of all the numbers in the array and return it. Then, in the main function, declare an array of integers with a predefined maximum size (e.g., 100), prompt the user to enter the values for the array, call the calculateAverage function to find the average, and finally, print the average value.

You can assume a maximum size for the array, such as 100, to simplify the implementation without using dynamic memory allocation.

Remember to handle input validation to ensure that the user enters valid integer values for the array elements.
